# homelab
Scripts, widgets and dashboards for my homelab

Currently my homelab is just 2 RPIs:
- RPI 5 8GB
- RPI 4B 4GB

I plan on running the following services:
- A simple LAN NAS for papers, bookmarks and content (websites, videos, etc)
- A discord bot with some stats for my discord server
- Another discord bot but for LLM integration via groq or ollama (need to decided)
- Personal note taking, completely offline with a simple Vector DB and RAG setup

## Future plans
- Maybe a simple intrusion detector
- Downtime notifier
- More compute to run better models
